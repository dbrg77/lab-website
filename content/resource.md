Here is some useful resource generated by the lab about genomics, especially single cell genomics. [Drop us an email](mailto:chenx9@sustech.edu.cn) if you have any questions.

**1. Are you bombarded by all sorts of single cell methods and unable to figure out their difference?**

- {{< icon vendor="feather" name="github" link="https://github.com/Teichlab/scg_lib_structs" >}} Check the [__scg_lib_structs__](https://github.com/Teichlab/scg_lib_structs) GitHub repository on the library structures of popular single cell methods.

**2. Do you want a uniform pipeline for the preprocessing of your single cell data?**

- {{< icon vendor="feather" name="book-open" link="https://scg-lib-structs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" >}} Check the [__Single Cell Genomics Library Preprocessing Pipelines__](https://scg-lib-structs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ReadTheDoc documentation.

**3. A `Snakemake` pipeline to preprocess the plate-based single cell ATAC-seq data**

- {{< icon vendor="feather" name="github" link="https://github.com/dbrg77/scATAC_snakemake" >}} Check the [__scATAC_snakemake__](https://github.com/dbrg77/scATAC_snakemake) GitHub repository.
