I'm teaching entry level undergraduate biostatistics (BIO210) and a practical short summer course on genetics and genomics (BIOS201). All course content is publicly available and you can access them from the following links:

- [__SUSTech-BIO210 Biostatistics__](https://dbrg77.github.io/SUSTech-BIO210)
- [__SUSTech-BIOS201 Genome, why we are different?__](https://dbrg77.github.io/SUSTech-BIOS201/)
