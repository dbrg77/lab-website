__Biography__

Xi did his BSc in Experimental Medicine at Peking University Health Science Centre in Beijing. He then joined Andy Sharrocks’ lab at the University of Manchester as a PhD student, studying the DNA binding specificity of different Forkhead transcription factors. After that, he went to join Sarah Teichmann’s group at the EBI as a postdoc to investigate T helper cell 2 (Th2) differentiation from an epigenetic point of view. In 2016, the Teichmann lab moved to the Sanger Institute, and he became a Senior Staff Scientist in the lab, working on techniques to study gene expression and epigenetics at the single cell level. In 2019, he joined the Department of Biology at SUSTech, Shenzhen, China as a tenure-track Assistant Professor.
