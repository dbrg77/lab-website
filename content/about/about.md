We have a long-standing interest in the molecular mechanisms of eukaryotic transcriptional regulation. The lab develop and utilise novel genomic technologies to study the mechanisms of cell fate decision and memory during cellular differentiation and early embryogenesis. We use mouse and zebrafish as model systems and primarily focused on the investigation of transcription factor binding events and chromatin status during those processes.
